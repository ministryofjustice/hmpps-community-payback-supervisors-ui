      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How you should be able to use this website</h2>

      <p>We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts using browser or device settings</li>
        <li>zoom in up to 400% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
        <li>navigate most of the website using a keyboard or speech recognition software</li>
        <li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.</p>

      <p>
      The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the Public Sector Bodies 
      (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 (the ‘accessibility regulations’). 
      If you’re not happy with how we respond to your complaint, contact the <a href="https://www.equalityadvisoryservice.com" class="govuk-link">Equality Advisory and Support Service (EASS)</a>.

      <p>HMPPS is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018. </p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Compliance status</h2>
      <p>
      This website is partially compliant with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.2 AA standard</a>, due to the non-compliances listed below.
      </p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Non-accessible content</h2>
      <p>
      The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.
      </p>
      <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
        <li>Some conditionally revealed input options are not announced by screen readers. This is not communicated via screen readers. This fails WCAG 2.2 success criterion 4.1.3 (AA) (Status Messages) and 4.1.2 (A) (Name, Role, Value). See known issues for <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/checkboxes/#known-issues">checkboxes</a> and <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/radios/#known-issues">radio buttons</a> in the GOV.UK Design System.</li>
        <li>When using NVDA, there is no visible focus indicator when items in the actions menu receive keyboard focus. This fails WCAG 2.2 success criterion 2.4.7 (AA) (Focus Visible). This has been raised with the Ministry of Justice design team.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What we’re doing to improve accessibility</h2>
      <p>We will continue to do internal audits to check the accessibility of this service, as well as taking feedback from users.</p>
      <p>Any changes required will be planned into our ongoing work on this service.</p>
